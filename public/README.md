The inspiration for this project came from the need for an all in one program that allows teachers and students to visualize Data Structures in a clean and organized way.

The goal of this project is to eventually allow teachers to be able to use this as an aid in teaching students all the different data structures and algorithms.

We as students would personally find this useful when trying to debug and understand code from our many projects.

 

## Code Description 👨‍💻

All of this code is written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

We have implemented the Gemini API and the Pitt API.

 

## How It Works ⚙️

This program is in the form of a website. There is an array and a linked list button that allows you to view these data structures in an organized way.

There is also a sidebar that includes a pen and eraser feature. In the future, we want to add all the data structures as well as the methods involved in each with detailed animations.

Unfortunetly we did not have enough time to implement these features, but the vision is complete. </br>
